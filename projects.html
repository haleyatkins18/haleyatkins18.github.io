<h2>Masters Thesis: Selecting for lysis in a temperate phage population</h2>
<p>
This project investigated whether temperate bacteriophages can be experimentally evolved into obligately lytic phages, which are more suitable for phage therapy. 

Aim 1: Isolation and characterization of Temperate <em>Escherichia coli </em> phages from urinary lysogens

Aim 2: Experimental Evolution: A modification of the Appelmans' Protocol to select for lysis in temperate phages
</p>

<p>
Aim 3: Temporal mutational analysis across hosts & protein-level analysis of adaptive mutations

<h2>Undergraduate Research: Lactobacillus Strain Comparison</h2>
<p>
This project examined whether the female urinary and vaginal microbiotas are connected by analyzing <em>Lactobacillus</em> strains commonly associated with urogenital health. Average nucleotide identity (ANI), alignment, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and CRISPR comparisons between strains from the same participant were performed. Simultaneously, simulations of genome assembly and ANI comparisons and present a statistical method for distinguishing related, unrelated, and identical strains.

<h2>Mitogenome Assembly Pipeline</h2>
<p>
Developed a bioinformatics pipeline to assemble mitogenomes from fish species using next-generation sequencing data.
