<h2>Masters Thesis: Selecting for lysis in a temperate phage population</h2>
<p>
This project investigated whether temperate bacteriophages can be experimentally evolved into obligately lytic phages, which are more suitable for phage therapy. 
Phages infecting <em>Escherichia coli</em> were isolated from urinary tract infection samples and characterized by morphology and host range. Experimental evolution was used to select for increased lytic behavior through repeated phage–bacteria co-culture, followed by genomic analysis to identify mutations associated with this shift.
