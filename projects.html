  <h2>Masters Thesis: Selecting for lysis in a temperate phage population</h2>
  <p>This project investigated whether temperate bacteriophages can be experimentally evolved into obligately lytic phages, which are more suitable for phage therapy. Phages infecting *Escherichia coli* were isolated from urinary tract infection samples and characterized by morphology and host range. Experimental evolution was used to select for increased lytic behavior through repeated phage–bacteria co-culture, followed by genomic analysis to identify mutations associated with this shift. This work advances understanding of phage evolutionary dynamics and explores new strategies to address antibiotic-resistant UTIs.</p>
  
  <h2>Undergraduate research: Lactobacillus strain comparison</h3>
  <p>This project examined whether the female urinary and vaginal microbiotas are connected by analyzing *Lactobacillus* strains commonly associated with urogenital health. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on 49 strains, including paired urinary and vaginal isolates from the same individuals, followed by comparative genomic analyses to assess strain relatedness. We found that half of the paired samples contained genetically identical strains, with additional evidence of shared ancestry between others. These results demonstrate microbial sharing between the urinary tract and vagina beyond known pathogens and have implications for future clinical approaches to women’s urogenital health.</p>

  <h2>Mitogenome assembly pipeline</h4>
  <p>Developed a bioinformatics pipeline to assemble mitogenomes from fish species using next-generation sequencing data. This pipeline is actively used in Dr. Yoel Stuart's lab at Loyola.</p>
